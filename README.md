# Enhancing_Search_Engine_Relevance_for_Video_Subtitles

🚀 Exciting News: Enhancing Search Engine Relevance for Video Subtitles is Now Live on Streamlit! 🚀

I'm thrilled to announce the completion of our Subtitles Search Engine project, offering a new level of sophistication in subtitle search! Our system focuses on enhancing search engine relevance for video subtitles, with a specific emphasis on semantic understanding and efficient retrieval.

🔍 Objective: Our goal was to develop an advanced search engine algorithm that efficiently retrieves subtitles based on user queries, leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance relevance and accuracy.

📚 Ingesting Documents: We meticulously processed a vast database of subtitle files, ensuring data integrity by sampling a random 30% of the data for optimal performance.

🧹 Cleaning Steps: Our system applies appropriate cleaning steps to ensure pristine subtitles, from removing noise to normalizing text.

💡 Keyword vs. Semantic Search Engines: We explored the difference between keyword-based and semantic search engines, with semantic engines understanding the deeper meaning and context of queries and documents for more nuanced and relevant results.

🔤 Text Vector Generation: We've experimented with two powerful techniques:

BOW/TFIDF: Ideal for a Keyword-Based Search Engine, generating sparse vector representations for lightning-fast searches.
BERT-based Sentence Transformers: For deeper semantic understanding, using BERT-based embeddings for rich semantic information.
📄 Document Chunker: Implementing a document chunking strategy to ensure no context gets lost, optimizing embedding performance by dividing documents into manageable chunks.

💾 Embedding Storage: We adopted advanced embedding storage techniques to efficiently store and retrieve document embeddings, enabling faster search and retrieval of relevant subtitles.

🙏 A big thank you to Kanav Bansal sir and #InnomaticsResearchLabs for their invaluable support.
